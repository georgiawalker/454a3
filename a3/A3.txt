CISC 454 Assignment 3
Due April 3, 2020

You are to implement the effects of

 - pixel antialiasing, 
 - glossy reflection, and
 - transparency

in a raytracer.  See "YOUR CODE HERE" in the supplied code.  The
'exampleOutput' directory contains examples of correct output for
the three effects.

Undergraduates may work in groups of two.  Graduate students must work
individually.

After getting your code working, create an interesting scene that
demonstrates each of these effects.  You may use digital models from
elsewhere and may use 3D editors to create your scene.  If you do
that, the objects will have to be in Wavefront (.obj) format.  Note
that not all Wavefront objects are parsable by the code here.

To Hand In

  The code must compile and run on Windows or Linux.
  
  Make a directory called 'a3'.  In that directory, put

    - These files: *.cpp, *.h, Makefile, wavefront.frag, wavefront.vert

    - a README.txt file with your name(s), student number(s), and
      email address(es)

    - two screen captured images in PNG format showing your one
      interesting scene and showing the three effects.

  Create a ZIP archive of the a3 directory.

  Email the archive to jstewart@cs.queensu.ca .
